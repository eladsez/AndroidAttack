        <item>&lt;b>Scrambled Net&lt;/b>" is a simple puzzle game which requires you to sort out the connections in a computer network, so that all the terminals are connected to the server. The network is made up of tiles, and while all the tiles are in the right place, they have been rotated randomly into a useless mess.

You need to rotate individual tiles to re-connect the network. Tiles which are connected to the server are shown highlighted. When all terminals are connected, you've won.

It may seem simple at first, but try working your way up through the five difficulty levels. You may think the novice level is a blast, but I guarantee it gets more challenging when some of the tiles are invisible! If it gets too hard, try the hints below.

Use the menu to select different skill levels, pause the game, or start a new game."</item>
        <item>Scrambled Net can be played with the keyboard, the touchscreen, or a combination of both:</item>
        <item>@array/help_play_texts</item>
        <item>"Scrambled Net has five levels of difficulty. Higher skill levels have larger boards, and the most advanced levels have some special features:

• "&lt;b>Novice&lt;/b>" gives you a small board to play with.

• "&lt;b>Normal&lt;/b>" level has a somewhat larger board.

• "&lt;b>Expert&lt;/b>" level uses a large board.

• "&lt;b>Master&lt;/b>" level also uses a large board; but as an added challenge, the board \"wraps around\". This means that a connection can go off the right edge, for example, and connect to the corresponding tile on the left edge; the same applies to the top and bottom edges. Also, you'll find some 4-way connections thrown in to the mix.

• "&lt;b>Insane&lt;/b>" level is the same as Master, but with the wrinkle that all 3-way and 4-way connections are invisible! You'll find that you need to figure out a whole new set of deductions to complete an insane puzzle. Be assured, though, that it "&lt;i>can&lt;/i>" be done!

One last note: to take full advantage of your device's capabilities, the actual number of tiles in a board is different for different devices. This means that Droid owners, for example, will find the game just a wee bit more challenging than it is on the Hero."</item>
        <item>"The device's \"menu\" button pops up a menu containing a number of options:

• "&lt;b>New game&lt;/b>" starts a new game, abandoning the current game if any.

• "&lt;b>Pause&lt;/b>" pauses the game, and covers the screen. Tap the screen to un-pause.

• "&lt;b>High scores&lt;/b>" displays a table of your personal best scores — both the fewest clicks in which you've solved each difficulty level, and the fastest time. You can use the menu to reset your scores. Press \"Back\" to get back to the game.

• "&lt;b>Skill level&lt;/b>" prompts you to select a skill level, then starts a new game at that skill level.

• "&lt;b>Solve it!&lt;/b>" runs an autosolver to finish the current puzzle for you. If you get completely stuck, you can use this to see the solution — but you won't get personal best credit! While solving, this menu item changes to a \"Stop\" button, so you can stop the autosolver at any time.

• "&lt;b>Sound&lt;/b>" lets you set your preferred sound effects level. However, the sound effects volume can always be adjusted in the game using the hardware volume keys. If no sound is coming out, try turning up the volume using the buttons.

• "&lt;b>Animation&lt;/b>" lets you turn the \"network data\" animation on or off.

• "&lt;b>Help&lt;/b>" displays this help.

• "&lt;b>About&lt;/b> displays version and license information.</item>
        <item>Here are some hints that may prove useful as you work through the difficulty levels.</item>

        <item>"With the touchscreen, you can simply tap any tile to rotate it once clockwise. Keep tapping until the tile is in the right orientation; if you need multiple turns to get it pointing the right way, that's still only counted as one click.

You can lock a tile in place to remind yourself that you have it set correctly... or at least you think you do. To lock a tile, press and hold the tile for a second; it will click and turn darker blue to indicate that it is locked. If you try to rotate a locked tile, it will display a flashing highlight. You can unlock it again by pressing and holding it.

Bear in mind that locking a tile is no indication that it is correct."</item>
        <item>"Using the keyboard, you can select tiles using trackball or directional keys. The currently selected tile is drawn with a red highlight around it. Once you have selected a tile, press Z, N or 4 to rotate it left; M, X or 6 to rotate right.

You can lock a tile in place to remind yourself that you have it set correctly... or at least you think you do. To lock a tile, press space or 0 (zero). The tile will click and turn darker blue to indicate that it is locked. If you try to rotate a locked tile, it will display a flashing highlight. You can unlock it again by pressing space or 0 (zero).

Bear in mind that locking a tile is no indication that it is correct."</item>

        <item>"The edges are a good place to start -- remember that a connection can never go off the edge of the board, so any tile which connects that way must be wrong. If a tile connects out to the right, then the next tile to the right must connect back to the left. In this way, once you have figured out one tile, you know something about the adjacent tiles.

A tile which does "&lt;b>not&lt;/b> connect in a given direction also tells you something about the next tile in that direction.</item>
        <item>You can &lt;i>sometimes&lt;/i> finish a level without using all the tiles; but you can &lt;b>always&lt;/b>" finish a level by using all the tiles. So you may assume that all tiles must have a valid connection.

Keep track of which tiles you "&lt;b>know&lt;/b> are correct by locking them -- press and hold a tile to lock it (see \"Playing the Game\" above). But be sure that you really have them correct.</item>
        <item>"Expert mode is just the same as before, only larger -- don't be discouraged!

Terminals always have exactly one connection, and all terminals have to connect to the server. If two terminals connect together without a branch, there's no way to hook them to the server; so that must be wrong."</item>
        <item>"In Master level, the edges no longer help you. Look for blocks of terminals together, and remember that two terminals can't be connected directly together. When you figure out one tile, look for all possible deductions you can make based on it."</item>
        <item>In Insane level, you will need to make use of all the deductions you have figured out, plus at least one new one. Remember that only 3-way and 4-way tiles are invisible; so an invisible tile can often tell you something about its neighbours.</item>
